This Typing Tutor game, developed in C, is designed to help users improve their typing speed and accuracy. It provides different difficulty levels and measures the time taken by the user to type a given sentence.

Two Difficulty Levels:

Easy Mode: A simple sentence to type.
Medium Mode: A more complex sentence to type with mixed capitalization.
Time Tracking: The game records the time taken to type the sentence.

Menu System: Allows the player to select difficulty levels or exit the game.

Looping Menu: The game runs in a loop until the user chooses to exit.

C Programming Concepts Used:
Loops (while) for menu execution
Functions (EasyMode(), mediummode()) for different difficulty levels
String handling (strcmp(), fgets()) for user input comparison
Time tracking (clock(), CLOCKS_PER_SEC) for measuring typing speed
Conditional statements (switch-case) for menu selection
